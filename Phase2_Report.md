# Phase 2 - Basic Structure and Main Functionalities

## Overview
This phase involved building the core structure of our React application, focusing on navigation, routing, and responsive layout using Bootstrap.

## Implemented Features

### Navigation Bar
- File: `src/components/Navbar.js`
- Used `react-bootstrap` and `react-router-dom` for routing between pages.
- Pages: Home, About, Contact

### Routing
- File: `src/App.js`
- Used `<Routes>` and `<Route>` to link pages without full page reload.

### Responsive Layout
- Bootstrap ensures the app adjusts across screen sizes.
- Navbar collapses on smaller screens using `<Navbar.Toggle>`.

### File Structure
/components/Navbar.js /pages/Home.js, About.js, Contact.js App.js, index.js, index.css
